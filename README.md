Instagram Creeper - Chrome extension for decoding Instagram image URLs


src contains and UNPACKED CHROME EXTENSION that can be loaded into the
Google Chrome browser via:
- go to "chrome://extensions" in the address bar
- click "Load unpacked extension..." button near the top of the page
- point it at the 'src' directory in this repo

Feel free to pack it and distribute it if you want. Just mention me or
something, so I get to feel all tingly inside.
